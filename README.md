## Employee DataBase: A Mystery in Two Parts

This is data engineering and analys project on employees of a corporation from the 1980s and 1990s using 6 CSV files: departments, dept_emp, dept_manager, employees, titles, and salaries. 

Tables were set up based on datatypes, primary and foreign keys as well as other constraints and the data was imported.

The following analysis was done within the database: 

* List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.

* List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.

* List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.

* List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

* List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."

* List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

* List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

* In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.

# Bonus

The data was analysed in Pandas to determine if it is genuine data, or fake data meant to be a test. The following can be found in the included Jupyter Notebook

* Create a histogram to visualize the most common salary ranges for employees.

* Create a bar chart of average salary by title.
